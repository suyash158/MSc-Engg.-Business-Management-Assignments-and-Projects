# Managing Design and Manufacturing Technology – Levi Stool Project

## 🪑 Project: Inclusive Stool Design for Acrophobic Users

As part of the **Managing Design and Manufacturing Technology (WM9F7-15)** module at the University of Warwick, our team developed an innovative stool product — the **Levi Stool** — designed for acrophobic (fear of heights) individuals. This project combined engineering design methods with practical business analysis to simulate a full product development lifecycle.
